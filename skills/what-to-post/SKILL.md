name: what-to-post
description: Decide what to post next on TikTok or Instagram Reels for a client, brand or account, with post ideas built on real viral videos from the Viral Swipe File library - each idea with a format, a hook and a linked reference video. Use when the user asks what to post, what to post this week or tomorrow, for fresh content ideas or post ideas for a client or niche, for a batch of ideas for several clients, or for help with a blank page.

# What to post

Explicit user instructions take priority over this workflow.

1. **Pin who it is for.** The client, brand or account, its niche, its
   platform and audience, and how many ideas the user wants (5 by default).
   For several clients, run the steps once per client and keep the answers
   apart.
2. **Resolve the niche** with `search_library` or `list_niches`. If two
   niches fit, say which one you used; if the niche is thin, read an
   adjacent one too and say so.
3. **Read what worked.** `list_videos` for the niche sorted by viral factor,
   about 30 videos, with `platform` when the user posts on one. Viral factor
   compares each video with its own account's usual views, so a small
   account's breakout counts as much as a big one's.
4. **Find what repeats.** Group the videos by format and by hook pattern,
   with how many of the videos you read use each. Read the two or three
   strongest with `get_video` for their full hook and description.
5. **Write the ideas.** For each idea give: the format, a new hook in a
   pattern that repeats, what to show, and the library video it learns from,
   with its hook quoted exactly, its viral factor and its link.
6. **Keep the line clear.** Library hooks are quotes with links; the ideas
   and new hooks are your writing. Never present an idea as one that went
   viral or promise that it will.

If the user asks for "this week" or "right now", say once that the library
holds past viral videos ranked by viral factor, not a live trend feed, then
answer from it. `list_videos` with `sort: "recent"` shows the newest
additions when the user wants them.
