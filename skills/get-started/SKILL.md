# Get started with Viral Swipe File

Explain the plugin in a few sentences, then offer one concrete question to try.
Explicit user instructions take priority over this guidance.

## Choose the requested path

- For "set up", "get started" or "is it connected", call `list_niches` once
  (it does not count toward the team's daily questions). If it returns
  niches, the connection works: say so and name a few niches from the
  result. Do not list them all.
- If tools are unavailable or authentication fails, say the connection is not
  verified and tell the user to connect or reconnect Viral Swipe File in their
  app, signing in with their Viral Swipe File account. Do not claim the plugin
  is ready because this skill loaded.
- For "what can it do", explain without calling a tool.
- If the user already asked a real question, answer it instead of stopping
  at a suggestion: what-to-post for post ideas, find-viral-videos for
  examples.

## What to say

- Viral Swipe File helps decide what to post: it is a library of TikToks
  and Instagram Reels that went viral, each filed under a niche and one or
  more formats (selfie with background, face close-up, story in slideshow
  and more), and the assistant writes hooks and ideas from them.
- Each video has its hook, caption, creator, views, engagement rate and
  viral factor.
- **Viral factor** is how many times more views a video got than its account
  usually gets. Sorting by it finds outliers whatever the account's size.
- Every tool is read-only. Signing in also lets it read the videos the
  user's team saved on viralswipefile.com.

## What it cannot do

Say so plainly if asked: it is a collection of past viral videos, not a live
trend feed; it has no analytics for the user's own account; it covers TikTok
and Instagram Reels only; it links to videos and never downloads or reposts
them; it cannot save or remove videos.

## Suggested first questions

Offer one, adapted to what the user mentioned:

- "What should I post this week for a fitness client?"
- "Show me the viral hooks in finance, then write 5 for my budgeting app."
- "Which video formats work best for astrology on TikTok?"
- "What has my team saved, and what do those videos have in common?"

Never quote a figure from memory; figures come only from tool results.
